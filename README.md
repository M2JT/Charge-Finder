# charge-finder

## Background & Objective
We all know how annoying it can be when our devices run out of battery, especially when we are out and about. Picture this: you forgot to charge your phone/laptop last night, but you’ve got a full day of outdoor work ahead. That’s why ChargeFinder is here. It is a handy app that saves you from the dreaded “low battery anxiety.” With ChargeFinder, you can quickly locate nearby spots where you can grab a shared power bank for a quick charge.
