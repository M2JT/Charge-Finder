# charge-finder

## Background & Objective
We all know how annoying it can be when our devices run out of battery, especially when we are out and about. Picture this: you forgot to charge your phone/laptop last night, but you’ve got a full day of outdoor work ahead. That’s why ChargeFinder is here. It is a handy app that saves you from the dreaded “low battery anxiety.” With ChargeFinder, you can quickly locate nearby spots where you can grab a shared power bank for a quick charge.

## How To Run This Project

### In the Front-end Directory
#### Set Up and Run the Front-end
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies listed in `package.json` onto your local machine. This is necessary before running our app, as the 3rd-party dependency code is excluded from version control by the `.gitignore` git settings file.
2. Create a `.env` file and save it in the current directory. To ensure this file is configured with the correct environmental variables, please contact our developers for more information, as those data are sensitive and not allowed to be publicly shared on GitHub.
3. Run `npm start` to start the front-end.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view our app in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.
